    </div>
    <p>Hi, I’m Jon. For over 40 years I’ve worked with people all over the world – from airlines and hospitality to education, business and leadership. What I’ve learned is simple: <strong>you already have the strength you need.</strong> Sometimes you just need the right space, the right questions, and the right support to bring it out.</p>

    <p>With me, you won’t get abstract theories or corporate buzzwords. You’ll get real conversations, reflection, and action – all built around your own story and the four life pillars I work with: <span class="page__lead text-purple">Body • Mind • Heart • Spirit</span></p>

            <h3>For Individuals</h3>
            <p>I help you gain clarity, build resilience, and create balance in your life. That could mean working on your mindset, your career, or simply finding a new direction. Sometimes it’s even on the road – through my Travel4Life experiences.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box box-half">
            <h3>For Businesses & Organisations</h3>
            <p>I also work with companies and teams. I help employees and leaders become stronger, healthier, more motivated – and that makes a real difference to the whole organisation. Career coaching is part of this, supporting people to grow where they are.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="/assets/images/jon.webp" alt="Jon Evans">
    </div>
    <p>I grew up on a small island, and ever since I was 17 I’ve worked and lived around the globe – 92 countries so far! I’ve worked with more than 100 nationalities, and I still love meeting new people.</p>

    <p>What drives me is simple: helping you become the best version of yourself.
    Sometimes that’s in a one-to-one coaching conversation, sometimes in a team workshop, sometimes in a leadership meeting. The common thread: it’s always real, always personal.</p>
